          OUR PHILOSOPHY
        </h1>
        <p class='textphilo'>The worlds oldest question: all work and no play, or all play and no work? 
                  So many of us have always struggled to find the correct balance between self-care
                  and productivity. This has inhibited and concealed so much hidden potential across
                  the globe. That's why Coup De Vie is delivering kits, around the globe, to help you 
                  achieve success, and amelioration. Our kits contain a range of items, which you can 
                  customise, to aid your self-care and reflection. </p>
        <p class='textphilo'>
                      The common denominator between all successful people is internal reflection. 
                  With every kit, no matter how small or big, you receive free Coup De Vie journal cards. 
                  They contain questions and prompts to discover what you need to achieve your 
                  dreams through your subconscious, and exclusive CDV advice from those on
                  Forbes 30 under 30, past The Apprentice winners and big names in several industries.

          WORKER'S RIGHTS
        </h1>
        <p class='textphilo'>
                  We rampantly call for all our workers to be unionize, and protect all worker's rights. We will
                  soon be supporting other unions around the world, especially in under-developed countries.

                  SUSTAINABILITY
        </h1>
        <p class='textphilo '>
                  We promise to be sustainable, which most importantly includes our
                  packaging. We use cardboard and paper packaging. Our totes are an
                  alternative to plastic bags.
                  However, as a small business, there is only so much change we can make. Currently,
                  we don't have a choice but to use mostly fossil fuels. Hence, why
                  we support and advocate for change in the fundamentals of our electricity, and to immediately 
                  make the swap to renewables.
